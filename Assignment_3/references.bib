abstract = { An intelligent autonomous robot is required in various applications such as space, transportation, industry, and defense. Mobile robots can also perform several tasks like material handling, disaster relief, patrolling, and rescue operation. Therefore, an autonomous robot is required that can travel freely in a static or a dynamic environment. Smooth and safe navigation of mobile robot through cluttered environment from start position to goal position with following safe path and producing optimal path length is the main aim of mobile robot navigation. Regarding this matter, several techniques have been explored by researchers for robot navigation path planning. An effort has been made in this article to study several navigation techniques, which are well suited for the static and dynamic environment and can be implemented for real-time navigation of mobile robot. }

abstract = {Reliable real-time extrinsic parameters of 3D Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and camera are a key component of multi-modal perception systems. However, extrinsic transformation may drift gradually during operation, which can result in decreased accuracy of perception system. To solve this problem, we propose a line-based method that enables automatic online extrinsic calibration of LiDAR and camera in real-world scenes. Herein, the line feature is selected to constrain the extrinsic parameters for its ubiquity. Initially, the line features are extracted and filtered from point clouds and images. Afterwards, an adaptive optimization is utilized to provide accurate extrinsic parameters. We demonstrate that line features are robust geometric features that can be extracted from point clouds and images, thus contributing to the extrinsic calibration. To demonstrate the benefits of this method, we evaluate it on KITTI benchmark with ground truth value. The experiments verify the accuracy of the calibration approach. In online experiments on hundreds of frames, our approach automatically corrects miscalibration errors and achieves an accuracy of 0.2 degrees, which verifies its applicability in various scenarios. This work can provide basis for perception systems and further improve the performance of other algorithms that utilize these sensors.},

  abstract={Recently Rao-Blackwellized particle filters have been introduced as effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution taking into account not only the movement of the robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches.},

The capability of an autonomous robot to locate itself within the environment and construct a map at the same time, it is known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). They are various sensors that are employed in a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) which characterized either as a laser, sonar and vision sensor. Visual Simultaneous Localization and mapping (VSLAM) is when autonomous robot embedded with a vision sensor such as monocular, stereo vision, omnidirectional or Red Green Blue Depth (RGBD) camera to localize and map the environment. Numerous researchers have embarked on the study of Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) with incredible results, however many challenges stills exist. The purpose of this paper is to review the work done by some of the researchers in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM). We conducted a literature survey on several studies and outlined the frameworks, challenges and limitation of these studies. Open issues, challenges and future research in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) are also discussed.},

abstract = {Currently, commercially available intelligent transport robots that are capable of carrying up to 90 kg of load can cost $5,000 or even more. This makes real-world experimentation prohibitively expensive and limits the applicability of such systems to everyday home or industrial tasks. Aside from their high cost, the majority of commercially available platforms are either closed-source, platform-specific or use difficult-to-customize hardware and firmware. In this work, we present a low-cost, open-source and modular alternative, referred to herein as “ROS-based Open-source Mobile Robot (ROMR)”. ROMR utilizes off-the-shelf (OTS) components, additive manufacturing technologies, aluminium profiles, and a consumer hoverboard with high-torque brushless direct current (BLDC) motors. ROMR is fully compatible with the robot operating system (ROS), has a maximum payload of 90 kg, and costs less than $1500. Furthermore, ROMR offers a simple yet robust framework for contextualizing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, an essential prerequisite for autonomous robot navigation. The robustness and performance of the ROMR were validated through real-world and simulation experiments.

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the development of a laser-based people detection and obstacle avoidance algorithm for a differential-drive robot, which is used for transporting materials along a reference path in hospital domains. Detecting humans from laser data is an important functionality for the safety of navigation in the shared workspace with people. Nevertheless, traditional methods normally utilize machine learning techniques on hand-crafted geometrical features extracted from individual clusters. Moreover, the datasets used to train the models are usually small and need to manually label every laser scan, increasing the difficulty and cost of deploying people detection algorithms in new environments. To tackle these problems, (1) we propose a novel deep learning-based method, which uses the deep neural network in a sliding window fashion to effectively classify every single point of a laser scan. (2) To increase the speed of inference without losing performance, we use a jump distance clustering method to decrease the number of points needed to be evaluated. (3) To reduce the workload of labeling data, we also propose an approach to automatically annotate datasets collected in real scenarios. In general, the proposed approach runs in real-time and performs much better than traditional methods. Secondly, conventional pure reactive obstacle avoidance algorithms can produce inefficient and oscillatory behaviors in dynamic environments, making pedestrians confused and possibly leading to dangerous reactions. To improve the legibility and naturalness of obstacle avoidance in human crowded environments, we introduce a sampling-based local path planner, similar to the method used in autonomous driving cars. The key idea is to avoid obstacles by switching lanes. We also adopt a simple rule to decrease the number of unnecessary deviations from the reference path. Experiments carried out in real-world environments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

In the last years human–robot interaction has become an important research field that spans all of the robot capabilities including perception, reasoning, learning, manipulation and navigation. For navigation, the presence of humans requires novel approaches that take into account the constraints of human comfort as well as social rules. Besides these constraints, putting robots among humans opens new interaction possibilities for robots, also for navigation tasks, such as robot guides. This paper provides a survey of existing approaches to human-aware navigation and offers a general classification scheme for the presented methods.}

In this paper, we design a receptionist robot that recognizes human face as well as speech, which enhances verbal interaction skill of robot. In addition, we design a reaction generation engine to generate appropriate reactive motions and speech. Moreover, we study which social skills are important to a hospital receptionist robot to enhance social interaction, such as friendliness and attention.

abstract = {A dead reckoning navigation system for autonomous mobile robot localization is presented. The navigation system was implemented by novel sensor fusion using a Kalman filter. A differential encoder and the gyroscope error models are developed for the filter. An indirect Kalman filter scheme is adopted to reduce the computational burden and to enhance the navigation system reliability. The filter, which feeds back the estimated errors to the main navigation system, mutually compensates the encoder errors and the gyroscope errors. To evaluate the filter performance, the observability of the filter was analyzed. The characteristics of unbounded position error growth in dead reckoning navigation system' has been shown by the observability analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed mobile robot navigation algorithm provides the reliable position and heading angle of the mobile robot without any help of external positioning system.}

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a mobile agricultural robot capable of performing high-capacity transport tasks within greenhouses in presence of people or other agricultural machines. The main objective is to provide the robot with enough technology to work collaboratively with nearby human workers. In addition, the robot must also be able to transport 100 kilograms in a safe way over uneven terrain, a characteristic not usually found in existing greenhouse robots. This is important to ensure the sustainability of intensive greenhouse cultivation, as it is essential to allow more flexible use of robots when adapting. This would allow for expanding infrastructure size and operating volume to suit different greenhouse conditions, thus maximizing production. The robot is fitted with different sensors to enable autonomous navigation, perception, and to identify the environment and the operators (3D LiDAR, stereo cameras, and ultrasound). It also features the hardware necessary for cloud connection to share data in real time. All sensors have been validated to work correctly, hence the robot can move around the greenhouse. With the software currently used for collaborative robotics, the ultrasounds correctly identify the environment, and cameras and LiDAR can locate the farmer correctly. In this work, several gaps in greenhouse robotics are addressed by designing, developing, and validating a collaborative mobile robot with advanced sensors and algorithms with IoT integration. The robot lays the foundation for the implementation of autonomous navigation, collaborating with farmers in real-time and efficient operation in complex greenhouse environments, laying the groundwork for future advances in agricultural automation.}

abstract = {The path-planning algorithms for autonomous mobile robot navigation are crucial, often relying on sampling-based methods. RRT* is a robust, sampling-based path planning algorithm. The sampling process in RRT* plays a pivotal role, where uniform sampling can lead to slow convergence, while non-uniform sampling offers faster convergence but may struggle in complex environments due to its limited exploration. Thus, achieving a balance between exploitation and exploration is essential when selecting the sampling method for the RRT* path-planning algorithm. To address this issue, this research paper introduces Hybrid-RRT*, a path planning method that utilizes hybrid sampling. This unique approach generates samples using both non-uniform and uniform samplers. Hybrid-RRT* is evaluated against three baseline path planning algorithms—RRT*-N, Informed RRT*, and RRT*—across three different 384x384 2D simulation environments. Compared to these baseline methods, Hybrid-RRT* achieves superior results across all five performance metrics: convergence rate, success rate, number of nodes visited, path length, and planning time. According to the numerical results, the proposed algorithm achieves a faster average convergence rate that is 76.14% higher than RRT*, 24% higher than Informed RRT*, and 3.33% higher than RRT*-N. Moreover, it reduces node exploration by an average of 48.53% compared to RRT* and 40.83% compared to Informed RRT*. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid-RRT* algorithm effectively addresses the issue of slow convergence with uniform sampling and the challenge of limited exploration with non-uniform sampling methods.}

In this paper, the design of DM algorithm based on behaviour trees and fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm for control of soccer robots are presented. The basic elements of the behaviour tree (BT) used in decision making process of soccer robots are described. The integration of BT and fuzzy logic is proposed to increase the flexibility of the decision made by DM modules. Given algorithms have been extensively tested in simulation and provided satisfactory results in run time and adaptation to the new situation. Also, the efficient navigation procedure is designed using fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithm. The obstacle avoidance algorithm uses fuzzy if-then rule base and inference mechanism for finding optimal path for avoidance of obstacles. The presented BT based decision making and fuzzy obstacle avoidance algorithms are used for control of the holonomic 4-wheel-driven soccer robots. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms in soccer robot control.},
